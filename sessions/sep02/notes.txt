1. loopfloat.cxx illustrates some of the problems with floating point numbers

2. collatz.cpp illustrates using good naming & putting comments in the code.
There are also a couple of useful emacs commands.

3. Shell programming.

Set a variable:

a=5

Display its value:

echo $a

Pipe:

echo 23 | ./collatz

(the output of the `echo' command is `piped' into the collatz executable)

Do you want to test your program for a bunch of values?

for x in 2 3 5 7 9 13 17 ; do echo $x | ./collatz ; done

(pay attention to where and where not a semicolon; also be generous with spaces)

With apologies for the amount of magic:

for x in $( seq 2 25 ) ; do echo $x | ./collatz ; done

Try it!
