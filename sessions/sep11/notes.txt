More Unix trickery:

!!
means repeat last command

!-2
means repeat penultimate command

!?foo?:p
display last command that contained "foo"
the ":p" suffix means "print" but do not execute
- do this if you're not sure that the command found is correct
- or if you know that you need to do edits on that command

Total Black Magic:
at one point I had

icpx -o newton newton.cpp && ./newton

to compile & run the newton code.
Now I want to do that with newton2.

!icpx:s/newton/newton2/:g&

Yes, you can do a substitute on a command line.
- the ":g&" means global edit: change all occurrences
- maybe add the ":p" to make sure the edit was correct
