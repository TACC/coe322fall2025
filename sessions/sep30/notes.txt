---- Wildcards:

ls *.cpp

lists all cpp files

ls a*.cpp

lists all cpp files with names starting with "a"

ls {a,b}*.cpp

lists all cpp files with names starting "a" or "b"

---- How to easily copy files from the public repository
- find the public repository and
export PUBLIC=/wherever
- put that line in your .bashrc
- now you can (assuming your are in the location where you want the file to go):
cp $PUBLIC/sessions/sep23/pointclass .
  where "." means current directory.

---- Juggling directories

Suppose you need to switch between two directories:

cd directory1
pushd directory2

now you can

pushd

to switch between the two.
If you are done with the second directory:

popd

================ C++

pointclass.cpp

illustrates an overloaded operator

stream.cpp

illustrates a class that generates all even numbers.
The only method of the object is "next" which generates the next number.
