================ Unix

1. I was wondering "When did I mention the `nm' command?"

  grep nm sessions/*/notes.txt

That is, search for `nm' in the `notes.txt' file in any subdirectory of `sessions'.

2. How do you efficiently copy a code from the session to your own area?

- go to the session directory, and do `pwd', let's say that gives

  /home/123/yourname/class_repo/sessions

- define a variable

  export SESSIONS=/home/123/yourname/class_repo/sessions

- add that line to your `.bashrc' file in your home directory
  so that it gets loaded every time you log in
- and now you can do in your own directory:

  cp $SESSIONS/oct28/rectangle.cpp .
