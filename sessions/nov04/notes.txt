1. Customize your prompt:

export PS1="[\h \W:\#] "

(in your .bashrc)

2. Don't keep `cd'ing around:

cd location1
pushd location2

and then `pushd' switches between the two locations.

3. You should really have a clone of the class repository
on stampede3. Then set

export SESSIONS= .... the place of the sessions directory ...

so that you can

cp -r $SESSIONS/nov04 somewhere/in/your/area

4. I've edited the cbuild script to be more clever about the compiler.
Note: if cmake says you are using gcc 11 for C++ then it's not picking up
the right compiler. This should be Intel 2025.

================ C++

nov04/safesqrt.cpp

is the template for the TDD exercises (lecture 13).
