================ Unix

Use of wildcards:
 - in which sudirectory is there a file with "Point" in the name
   ls */Point*
 - in which subdirectory is there a cpp file containing the string "Point"
   grep Point */*.cpp

Note: grep is case sensitive; you can use
   grep -i point */*.cpp
for case-insensitive. If you want that as default
   alias grep='grep -i'
which you can put in your .bashrc

=============== C++ files

vector.cpp : illustrates overloading the index operator

rectangle.cpp : illustrates inheritance
