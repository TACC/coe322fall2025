The `primefun.cpp' program states whether an input number is prime.

You should easily be able to write this program.
If you have trouble, try writing a program for "perfect numbers":
numbers that are the sum of their divisors. Example
6 = 1 + 2 + 3
28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14
There are two more under 10 thousand.

Two things to remark;
- this program separates declaration & definition of the function
- it uses the "boolalpha" function from the "iomanip" header to display a boolean

To test your program, you can
- test a single number: run and type it, or
- echo 17 | ./prime
- test a range by
for i in {5..500} ; do echo $i | ./prime ; done
