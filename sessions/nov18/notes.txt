================ Unix

1. The program `returncode.cpp' does `return 2'.
You can catch that return in the shell:

./returncode
echo $?

The variable `$?' is a number 0-255 where 0  by convention indicates success,
and anything else an error code.

2. Suppose you have a commandline

icpx -o program1 program1.cpp && ./program1

and you want to do that for `program2':

!ic:s/program1/program2/:g&:p

-- `!ic' : get the last command starting with `ic'
-- `:s/program1/program2/' : edit that command to substitute program1 by program2
-- `:g&' : and do that substitution globally
-- `:p' : print it out, just to be sure, and then do `!!' to actually execute it.

================ gdb

Make sure you compile your code with the `-g' option.

If you use cmake, add the option `-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug' to
the cmake invocation.
