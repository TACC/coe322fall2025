================ C++

File fmt235.cpp is the skeleton for the I/O exercise.

Note: the "println" function needs C++23 meaning intel/25

module load intel/25
module save # to save it as your default environment

Now you can compile with

icpx -std=c++23 yourprogram.cpp -o yourprogram

================ Shell scripting

File run_ff.sh
- is used as

./run_ff.sh 15

This
- runs a program "ff"
- pipes a number into this program
- that number is the first commandline argument: $1
- there is a test to make sure that the number of arguments $#
  is more than zero.

Note the first line "#!/bin/bash":
this means that running the script starts a new shell:
as if you log in and starts a completely new session

To make the file actually executable:

chmod +x run_ff.sh

"Change the mode to be executable"
You can display the permissions of a file by

ls -l run_ff.sh
