================ Compilation

vector.cpp, named_vector.cpp, named_vector.h

Illustration of separate compilation
- the main program only uses a header file
- the header file declares the class name & names of methods & data members
- the implementation file contains the actual code of class members

# compile implementation file
# Note the "-c" flag!
icpx -std=c++23 -c named_vector.cpp

# compile main program
icpx -std=c++23 -c vector.cpp

# link together object files
# this has the "-o" flag
icpx -std=c++23 -o vector vector.o named_vector.o

================ namespace

The file "swap.cpp" illustrates a problem with "using namespace":
this file should not compile yet it does
because the namespace implicitly declares a whole bunch of functions.
