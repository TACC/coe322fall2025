This directory contains

- unfinished code for the "angle" exercise
- a cmake setup for compiling this.

To do the regular CMake workflow (see slides in the tutorials directory):

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

If there is an error in your cpp file, you only have to rerun "make".

Problem:
- if you look at the cmake output you'll see that it is not using the intel c++ compiler
- so call:

CXX=icpx cmake ........whatever......

You can also do:

export CXX=icpx

and then call cmake, or put that export line in your bashrc file and it will automatically
be executed every time you log in.

Next problem:
- if you rerun cmake & make, cmake gets confused by all the temporary crud it generated the first time.

So it's better to create the build directory everytime.
I did the following:

( rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build && CXX=icpx cmake .. && make && ls )

- "rm -rf" deletes the build directory, whether it's there or not
- mkdir et cetera does the regular cmake workflow
- I am using "&&" to sequence all these command
  This is better than "command1 ; command2 ; command3":
  With the semcolon, command2 would be executed even if command1 fails
  With "&&" any failing command aborts the rest of the line.
- I enclose the whole thing in parentheses to create a "subshell",
  which executes the whoe sequence
