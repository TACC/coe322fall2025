================ Unix isms:

the `history' command givs you all previous commands;
do for instance

history | grep icpx

to find all invocations of the compiler.
You can reinvoke a command by number:

$ history | grep icpx | tail -n 5
 1290  man icpx
 1298  #icpx -c func.cpp
 1301  icpx -c func.cpp
 1303  icpx -c func.cpp
 1323  history | grep icpx | tail -n 5
[staff sessions:320] !1303
icpx -c func.cpp

Advanced:
Compilation with "-c" gives you a ".o" file: object file.
You can investigate those with `nm':

[staff oct14:325] nm -C func.o
0000000000000000 T F::print()
                 U std::basic_ostream<char, [....]
                 U std::ios_base_library_init()
                 U std::cout

saying among other that "std::cout" is Undefined in this file,
and "T" indicates that "F::print" is defined in this file.
