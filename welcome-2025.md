# Welcome

Greetings everyone!

I'm Victor Eijkhout, the class professor for Scientific Computation, COE 322 and I'm co-teaching with Susan Lindsey. She and I both work for the [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://tacc.utexas.edu/) (TACC) on the [Pickle Research Campus](https://www.utexas.edu/research/off-campus-research-sites) at UT Austin.

The first few days of class can be a bit bumpy and administrative. Please read the following prior to our first class meeting to acquaint yourself with the class logistics and requirements.

See you in class,
Victor


## Class Logistics

* **Class Meeting Information**: We will conduct in-person classes every Tuesday and Thursday, 3:30-5:00pm, in building CPE 2.206 on the main UT Campus.
* **Course Communication**: We will employ the Slack application for communication during class and outside of class. We recommend you download the Slack application rather than use Slack through the browser. 

	* Download: [Slack for Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows)
	* Download: [Slack for Mac](https://slack.com/downloads/mac)

	Join the "TACC Learn" Slack workspace and the `#2025-coe322-general` channel.  Post a "hello" to introduce yourself.

	**Slack Invite: [Join class Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/tacc-learn/shared_invite/zt-2p8bpr3gw-d2MpUDfYP1vjm6nQj7GM7g)**

* **Office Hours**: Instructor office hours Tuesday 2-3pm ASE 5.224
* **Zoom Recordings**: Zoom recordings of each class section will be available via Canvas.


## Course Materials

**Equipment Requirements:** A laptop or tablet capable of connecting to the internet. Our classroom has few outlets, so make sure your devices are charged.


Lecture slides, code examples, the course textbook and all course materials will all be freely available and stored in the class GitHub repository. Take a look to get started.

**Class Repository: [TACC/coe322fall2025](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2025)**

To make a copy/clone of this repository to your local computer:

<pre>localhost$ <b>git clone https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2025.git</b></pre>

We'll frequently add content to this repository. To refresh and sync up the repository as new items are added and edited:

<pre>localhost$ <b>cd coe322fall2025; git pull</b></pre>

### Syllabus

View the class syllabus in the class repo: <https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2025/blob/main/coe322_syllabus.pdf>.

### Textbook

Our textbook is [Introduction to Scientific Programming](). The book is available in PDF form in the class repository.  Check out Dr. Eijkhout's other books at [The Art of HPC](https://theartofhpc.com/) too.


## Setting up your Coding Environment

We conduct all course work on one of TACC's supercomputers that we're calling the "ISP Machine" or just "ISP" (for **I**ntroduction to **S**cientific **P**rogramming). The ISP machine is a virtual environment set up on TACC's Stampee3 system. In order to login or gain access to any TACC resources, you must create a TACC Portal account.

In addition monitoring the class repo, which will contain all the course materials, each student will create their own **private** GitHub repository.
Each student will create their own **private** Github repository to store and manage homework assignments. The repository will be private to each student and shared only with the instructors and TA for grading purposes.

### TACC Portal Account Creation Steps

* If you are registered in this class you should have already received an email invitation to set up your TACC Account. If you have not yet clicked the link in that email, please do so and complete the account creation process.  If you already have a TACC account, from another class or through your advisor, you should have seen an email that you have been added to the project for the class.  Otherwise, register for a TACC Portal Account here: <https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/register>.

* Set up Multi-Factor Authentication. TACC requires Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) when accessing any of our compute resources. Follow this tutorial to set up MFA: [Multi-Factor Authentication at TACC.](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/basics/mfa/).

* After account creation, wait at least 15 minutes before logging on to the ISP machine: `isp.tacc.utexas.edu`.

### GitHub Repository Creation Steps

Follow the first three steps in GitHub's Quickstart guide to create your own repository.

* [Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world)
* [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git)
* [Create a Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories)

Once created, click on "Manage Access" to invite the instructors ((usernames: `VictorEijkhout`, `susanunit`).to view your repository. In the screenshot below, the professor is being invited to the private repo created above.
